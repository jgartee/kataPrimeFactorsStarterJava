### Generate the set of prime factors of each supplied integer value as a collection of primes

e.g.  
1 => [ ]  
2 => [2]  
3 => [3]  
4 => [2, 2]  
5 => [5]  
6 => [2, 3]  
7 => [7]  
8 => [2, 2, 2]  
9 => [3, 3]  
10 => [2, 5]  
11 => [11]  
12 => [2, 2, 3]  
etc.  

Remember a prime number is a number evenly divisible only by itself and 1.  1 is not a prime number. 

Fun fact: If a number is not a prime number, is is known as a *composite* number
